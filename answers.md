- In action creators, like `getFilmFromAPI`, we use a "regular expression" ---
  what is that regular expression, and what is its purpose?

  This regular expression is used to extract the film ID from the URL. It uses a /d+/ match which will match any number of digits.
  
- We're persisting the Redux store, so if you re-visit the app, it will remember
  the topics you've visited. Where is this stored? How is this done?

  Redux-persist stores the store in the local storage of the browser. Redux persist works as middleware that wraps the entire application one level under the the Provider.
  This uses a persist gate. 


- What does `combineReducers` do? Why are we using it? 

Comine reducers lets you use multiple reducers spread out across multiple files. This allows you to have a single store that is made up of all different parts of the application.
It allows us to make our core more modular and neater.

- How does the "Reset to Fresh Exploration" feature work?

The reset all dispatches an action that returns all stores to the default states.

- Why are `FilmList.js`, `PlanetList.js`, and 
  `PersonList.js` all simple components that use an `ItemList`?
  Why is this a good design?

The ItemList is a simple and reusable component. It is used in all 3 places and all one has to do is populate the list with the correct data.

- In the `HomePage` component we use the `useSelector` hook to save only a single fact---
  whether the first film is loaded, We could instead have selected all the
  films, and had the check for whether the first film is loaded in our
  `render` function. Why is this worse? What would the performance implications
  be?
  
If we had selected all the films, the useSelector hook would've potentially forced more unnecessary renders. To this end we are only checking for one film and not all of them.

- What good ideas for designing and organizing React apps have you learned from
  studying this code?

I have learned how to use an external library to keep our states persistent across refreshes. I have also learned how to structure a proper store.
  
- Which Star Wars character would make the best React developer, and why?

Darth Vader. As a kid, he did consistent work on R2D2 and C3PO. While we're mostly shown him working on the hardware side of things, it can be assumed that he's done plenty of software work. Working with hardware one can see how mutability and reusability in components is important, as well has having an organized structure.
